# Fine-Tuning (Tensorflow)
Using textual inversion to fine tune keras' Stable Diffusion model in order to combine two rather opposed concepts like broccoli and emotions in a certain style in Tensorflow. Training and testing a pretrained ResNet to classify the emotion depicted in the generated images. 

# Usage: 
The code for training the finetuning model and generating images is to be found in the folders "four_emotions" and "two_concepts". Each includes a training.ipynb which can be used for training new weigths on the task, a textual_inversion.py and an image_generation.ipynb, which can be used for generating new images of broccoli with emotions, using either own pretrained weights or weights provided by us. For further instructions see coments in the files.
Choose whether to use "four_emotions" or "two_concepts" depending on whether you want images generated by training on the emotions "happy", "sad", "angry" and "in love" at the same time or whether to train the concept of a broccoli sticker and the concept of an emoji simultaneously and later combining them.

The file "ResNet.ipynb" contains the pretrained, customized ResNet50 used by us including image preprocessing.

In the folder "Experiments", our results such as ResNet accuracy and loss and various Cosine Similarities are to be found.
